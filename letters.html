                        <p>We aim to create an environment where participants can express themselves freely, share their ideas, and develop their diplomatic skills. It is our greatest desire to host a conference atmosphere where every delegate's opinion is valued, constructive debate is encouraged, and a solution-oriented mindset is embraced.</p>
